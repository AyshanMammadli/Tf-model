# Tf-model
This model will predict handwriting or print numbers

0.png >>> Model predicts it as 6 

1.png >>> Model predicts it as 1

2.png >>> Model predicts it as 2

3.png >>> Model predicts it as 3, may be the curves of number 3 help it in prediction

4.png >>> Model predicts it as 4, beacuse it looks like print 4

5.png >>> Model predicts it as 6,  because if we close up left side, it looks like 6

6.png >>> Model predicts it as 5

7.png >>> Model predicts it as 7, because it looks like handwriting 7


8.png >>> Model predicts it as 8, 2 circles in the picture may help it to predict number 8

9.png >>> Model predicts it as 9, because it looks like handwriting 9
